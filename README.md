# latheType3DPrinter

this is a dump of files related to mod to convert a standard 3D-Printer to a lathe type 3D-printer. A lathe type printer prints on rolls, as described in https://de.scribd.com/doc/147351838/Lathe-Type-3D-Printer. Printing on a bottle was shown at the 35C3.

# hardware

The basis for the modifaction is a ANET A8 printer. This printer was used, because i expected to destroy the hardware while experimenting (so this is no recomendation). Luckily the hardware still lives.

The main modification was to remove the heatbead and to replace it with a roll.

## removing the heatbed

The heatbed can be removed the basicaly doing the build process in reverse. The heatbed, the gliders and the rod holding the heatbed were removed. To not confuse the 3Dprinter the heatbed was put next to the 3Dprinter with the wirering still attached. It may server as a tea warmer from now on.

## choose a roll

Choose a sturdy and round rod or pipe to print on. The usual rules for surfaces apply. For PLA i found that paper rolls and a steel pipe covered in masking tape worked well. Bottles are fun, but not easy to work with. This is because the fillament (PLA) doesn't sick well on cold metal/glass. Putting masking tape or smearing a layer of glue on the roll helps with the adhesion. 

The roll should be as round as possible. Bottles are actually not round and paper rolls are often ovals, too. For carpet rolls plastic parts exist that ensure roundness and have centered holes that can be usefull for mounting. For metal pipes ensure a clean cut so the pipe doesn't wobble later. A properly manufactured roll would probably best.

## mounting the roll

build some sort of contraption that holds the roll in place. The contraption should
